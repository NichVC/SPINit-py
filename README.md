# SPINit-py
Python 3 module for loading, processing and analyzing SPINit data/log files.

It is especially oriented towards SPINit data/log acquired from a SpinAligner setup (_e.g._, solid state build-up curve / Microwave frequency/power sweeps _etc_).

Data examples are provided in the "data_example" folder.

Usage examples are shown in testSPINit.py and testSPINit-py.ipynb.
